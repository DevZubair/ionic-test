 Above you can see is that I have added some dependencies, basically I would be needing express framework and mongoose
 ahead. Express is used for simplifying Node.js and mongoose is used for creating collections and schemas in mongoDB.
 
 How to install these dependencies:
 1) Create a file package.json
 2) Add a name of your project and version (optional).
 3) Create dependencies list (Could be add later if forgot any)
 4) Open New terminal
 5) $ npm install
 6) It will download and will add all the files in a folder named node_modules.
